🧠 Handwritten Digit Recognition using Python (Jupyter Notebook)
This project demonstrates a simple yet powerful Handwritten Digit Recognition system built using Python and run in Jupyter Lab. It leverages machine learning techniques to classify images of handwritten digits (0–9), commonly using the MNIST dataset.

🔍 Features
Built entirely in Python using Jupyter Lab for interactive development.

Uses popular ML libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or Keras (based on implementation).

Trains a model on thousands of labeled digit images.

Predicts handwritten digits with high accuracy.

Visualizes input samples and prediction results using Matplotlib.
